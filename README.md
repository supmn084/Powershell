Chris's Random Powershell Scripts

This is a repo where I have examples from books, sites, other dumps, and  frankenstein scripts I've created for fun. Heavily influenced by random bits of my day to day career or stuff I've found online and thought was fun to tinker with in my home lab. 

## Getting Started

Feel free to clone this repo with whatever flavor or method of git you like to use. 

### Prerequisites

This assumes you have a windows 10 PC running powershell 5 or above, and a pulse. 

## License

Nothing needed here. It's powershell...it's free.

## Acknowledgments

* Books by Ed Wilson, James Hicks and various snippets found online.
* Thanks for reading to this point
* Bits and bobs of scripts and examples found online may be chopped into pieces here and there.
