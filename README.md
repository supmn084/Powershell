Chris's Random Powershell Scripts

This is a repo where I have examples from books, sites, other dumps, and  frankenstein scripts I've created for fun. Heavily influenced by random bits of my day to day career or stuff I've found online and thought was fun to tinker with in my home lab. 

## Getting Started

Feel free to clone this repo with whatever flavor or method of git you like to use. 

```
git clone https://github.com/supmn084/Powershell.git
```

### Prerequisites

This assumes you have a windows 10 PC running powershell 5 or above, and a pulse. 

### Folder Layout

A lot of this repo has folders for various powershell or other scripting languag books where I have the working examples through the chapters, and the quizes at the end. You'll want to look into other folders aside from those for other scripts and little items or examples I've made

## License

Nothing needed here. It's powershell...it's free.
